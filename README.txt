Usage instructions:
From the forge prompt, run the "richfaces setup" command to install the RichFacesFacet.  Installing the RichFacesFacet installs the required web.xml, and sets up your pom.xml.

Once the Facet is installed, you are ready to develop your RichFaces based application.

To install a simple example facelet page, run the "richfaces install-example-facelet" command.
